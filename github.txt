What is Github?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to help 
developers manage and collaborate on software projects. It provides a user-friendly 
interface for Git repositories, allowing users to store their code, track changes,
 collaborate with others, and manage project workflows. GitHub also offers features 
like issue tracking, project management tools, and a social networking aspect for 
developers.
